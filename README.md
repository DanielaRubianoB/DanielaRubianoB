### 👩‍🔬 About Me

I’m a **Biomedical Engineer with a Master’s degree**, specialized in medical device design. My academic foundation trained me to interpret complex data and transform it into actionable solutions.

📈 I later transitioned into **data analytics**, driven by my passion for insights, decision-making, and process improvement. I worked as a **Data Analyst at Neptune S.A.S**, where I:
- Translated large datasets into business insights  
- Created dashboards and KPIs using **Excel, Python, SQL and Tableau**  
- Supported cross-functional teams with marketing, product, and operations data

📚 Alongside hands-on experience, I earned certifications in:
- **AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner, GenAI Practitioner & Machine Learning Engineer – Associate**  
- **Tableau Desktop Specialist**  
- **Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate**

🎨 I also created **My Universe**, a crochet brand that blends storytelling and design with a community of over **40,000 followers**. It reflects my ability to combine data, branding, and creativity in meaningful ways.
